## v1.3.0 (2021-05-11)

### Added

  on `Device` records.

### Fixed

- #43 - Development and CI testing now defaults to Nautobot 1.0.0 instead of 1.0.0b3
- #43 - Fix test approach to ensure that tests execute against the test database rather than the development database.

- #5 - Pydantic `ValidationError` is now caught when constructing internal data models
- `Device`s with no specified `name` can now be imported successfully.
- Device component templates are now imported _after_ `Device`s so as to avoid encountering errors when components are unexpectedly created from the templates.
